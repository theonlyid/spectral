# About source code organisation

This folder contains the source code for each module that resides in a subfolder within 'src' with the same name as the module.

It also contains a list of dependecies for Matlab and Python. These are other libraries/toolboxes/modules that need to be installed/available for the source code to work properly. Please make sure to add them to the respective txt file.

## Adding source code

To add your module's source code, create a folder under src with your module's name and add your files there. This should ensure a manageable and readable tree structure for the repository.

Don't forget to add documentation in the [docs](../docs/about.md) folder!
