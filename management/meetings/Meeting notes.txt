Layout for meeting notes:

date - time - participants
place

Issues:

Concerns:

Decisions:

--> please fill in meeting notes right after the meeting. 
--> send notes to the other participants (via slack) so they can check/add/edit the notes within one day.

06. Feb. 2020 - 4pm - Meeting Ali & Jenny
Ali's office

Issues:
- how to maintain meeting minutes?

Concerns:

- by adding confluence as a tool we might overcomplicate things.
- having seperate files for each meeting makes it more difficult to search for specific points/decisions.

Decisions:
1) keep meeting minutes in a single text file in the repo () (bitbucket).
2) text file is updated after every meeting (bitbucket).
3) the updates will be shared via slack, the team has 1 day to review/edit the notes (slack).

05. Feb. 2020 - 3pm - Meeting Ali, Henry, Jenny, Vinod
Jenny's office

Issues:
- what would be a good first approach to analyse the fMRI data?

Information provided by Ali & Vinod:
- we want to identify temporal components in fMRI  to get a handle for the LFP.
- dynamic functional connectivity analysis could be one approach. (can be done using a package from NKI (c-pack) or CN (SPM-MatLab))
- dual regression analysis could be one approach.

Concerns:

Decisions:
1) will proceed with dynamic FC analysis based on scripts provides by Vinod (bitbucket).
2) Ali and Jenny will meet with Vinod on Friday, 07. Feb. 2020, around 3pm-ish, to check the quality of the data.
3) for that Jenny will bring a sample datatset on a USB stick.
4) Ali and Jenny will meet with Vinod on Monday, 20. Feb 2020, 6pm, to start implementing a pipeline for fMRI analysis (bitbucket).

04. Feb. 2020 - 4pm - Meeting Henry, Jenny, Yusuke
Jenny's office

Issues:
- get more information on the cleaning process of ephys data
	- can we adapt the parameters per monkey/channel?
	- how does Nikos clean his data?
- when is a channel good/bad?

Information provided by Yusuke:
    - can adapt parameters per monkey but not per channel.
    - signal between gradient changes = RF-pulse & slice selection.
    - all changeable parameters can be found in clnmain.m.
    - cleaning removes components for every segment.
    - the higher the # of components, the worse.

Concerns:
- could the cleaning we are currently performing be done better

Decisions:
1) cleaning can only minimally be improved.
2) Jenny will clean some test data with different parameters.
3) Jenny will show Yusuke a selection of plots and Yusuke will teach her which channel is good/bad.
4) Once Jenny has learned she will clean all the data and select the channels.
