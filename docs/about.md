# About documentation organisation

This documentation folder contains docs for the modules developed in either Python, Matlab or bash.

Each module has it's own README.md, html, pdf documentation and example notebooks in the subdirectory with it's name.

## Adding documentation

Please create a directory with the name of your module/package and add all documentation there. This is to ensure there are no conflicts with commonly named files such as "index.html or "README.md".
