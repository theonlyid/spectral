Generate Documentation

M2HTML: Documentation System for Matlab in HTML: both easy and quick to run . 
The output is very nice if the source code has a M-file header . 
Nice features a with Graph, each HTML output file gives dependencies, parent functions

Sphinx MATLAB domain: it's free and automatically generates documents from H1 comments if they are formatted using Sphinx markup.

MATLAB® Report Generator™: couldn't find too much info on it yet, we should try it out.

Doxygen: recommended by users but requires many additional programs and not well supported

makehtmldoc: creates a HTML doc for each M-File. cannot include equations and pictures


Recommendation: M2HTML appears to be the most well liked by users and the simplest. 
For more extensive types of documentation, Doxygen would be the next recommendation.
